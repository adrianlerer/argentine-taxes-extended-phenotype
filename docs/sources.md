# SOURCES AND METHODOLOGY - GAME THEORY LITERATURE SELECTION

## SELECTION CRITERIA

This annotated bibliography was constructed using **systematic selection criteria** to identify the most influential and relevant works in game theory, political economy, and public finance for understanding Argentina's Ingresos Brutos problem.

### Primary Selection Criteria

1. **Theoretical Foundation**: Works that establish foundational concepts in federal bargaining, tax competition, credible commitment, transitional mechanisms, or constitutional political economy

2. **Empirical Relevance**: Studies that analyze similar fiscal federalism problems in developing countries or federal systems with credible commitment challenges

3. **Citation Impact**: Works with high citation counts (>500 citations in Google Scholar) or recognized as seminal in their subfield

4. **Policy Applicability**: Literature that provides actionable frameworks for reform design, particularly regarding compensation mechanisms and institutional design

5. **Argentina-Specific**: Works that directly analyze Argentina's institutional context (Spiller & Tommasi 2007) or are frequently cited in Argentine policy debates

### Literature Search Strategy

The bibliography was constructed through:

1. **Backward Citation Search**: Starting from recent surveys (Keen & Konrad 2013, Oates 1999, Weingast 2014), traced citations to foundational works

2. **Forward Citation Search**: Identified highly-cited recent works that build on foundational theories

3. **Expert Consultation**: Cross-referenced with reading lists from leading fiscal federalism courses (Stanford, Harvard, MIT) and Argentine policy institutions (CIPPEC, FIEL, IERAL)

4. **Database Searches**: 
   - EconLit: "fiscal federalism" AND ("tax competition" OR "credible commitment" OR "constitutional political economy")
   - Google Scholar: "federal bargaining" AND "subnational taxation"
   - JSTOR: "transitional mechanisms" AND "reform sequencing"

### Thematic Organization Rationale

The 40 sources are organized into **5 thematic clusters** that map directly to Argentina's Ingresos Brutos problem:

#### 1. Federal Bargaining Theory (8 sources)
**Why this cluster**: Explains why Argentina's federal-provincial "bargain" has broken down, leading provinces to adopt defensive taxation strategies

**Seminal works**: 
- Riker (1964): Originator of federal bargain concept
- Weingast (1995): Market-preserving federalism framework
- Bednar (2009): Modern synthesis of federal safeguards

**Argentina-specific**: Wibbels (2005) analyzes developing country federations; Spiller & Tommasi (2007) focus specifically on Argentina

#### 2. Tax Competition (10 sources)
**Why this cluster**: Ingresos Brutos is a tax competition problem—24 provinces competing non-cooperatively, creating cascading externalities

**Seminal works**:
- Tiebout (1956): Foundational "voting with feet" model
- Zodrow & Mieszkowski (1986): Race-to-the-bottom theory
- Keen & Konrad (2013): Comprehensive modern survey

**Relevance**: Shows why provinces can't self-coordinate elimination without federal enforcement

#### 3. Credible Commitment (9 sources)
**Why this cluster**: **The core theoretical diagnosis**—federal government can't credibly commit to compensate provinces, so provinces maintain inefficient taxation as insurance

**Seminal works**:
- North & Weingast (1989): **The foundational credible commitment paper** (8,000+ citations)
- Kydland & Prescott (1977): Time-inconsistency problem (Nobel Prize 2004)
- Acemoglu & Robinson (2006): Commitment through institutional change

**Argentina-specific**: Spiller & Tommasi (2007) apply commitment theory directly to Argentina's weak institutions

#### 4. Transitional Mechanisms (7 sources)
**Why this cluster**: Even if commitment problem solved, need theory for **how** to transition from Ingresos Brutos to IBS/CBS

**Seminal works**:
- Roland (2000): Big bang vs. gradualism theory (post-communist transitions)
- Fernandez & Rodrik (1991): Status quo bias under uncertainty
- Lau, Qian & Roland (2000): China's dual-track reform

**Policy relevance**: Provides frameworks for designing 10-15 year phase-out schedules (Brazil model)

#### 5. Constitutional Political Economy (6 sources)
**Why this cluster**: Shows why **constitutional** (not statutory) guarantees are necessary for credible commitment

**Seminal works**:
- Buchanan & Tullock (1962): Foundational constitutional economics text
- Buchanan (1987): Nobel Prize lecture on constitutional constraints
- Wicksell (1896/1958): Benefit principle and unanimity requirement

**Policy relevance**: Explains why India's 101st Amendment (constitutional GST compensation) succeeded while Argentina's Consenso Fiscal (statutory) failed

## CROSS-DISCIPLINARY INTEGRATION

The bibliography integrates insights from:

1. **Economics** (30 sources):
   - Public finance: Oates, Zodrow & Mieszkowski, Gordon
   - Political economy: Acemoglu & Robinson, Persson & Tabellini
   - Institutional economics: North & Weingast, Greif
   - Transition economics: Roland, Dewatripont & Roland

2. **Political Science** (8 sources):

## GAPS IN THE LITERATURE

While this bibliography is comprehensive for theoretical foundations, **three gaps** remain:

### Gap 1: Quantitative Structural Models
**Missing**: Formal quantitative models of cascading taxation in federal systems

**Closest existing work**: Keen & Konrad (2013) survey tax competition models, but none explicitly model cascading

**Implication**: Future research should develop structural model of Ingresos Brutos cascading to quantify efficiency loss

### Gap 2: Political Economy Micro-Foundations
**Missing**: Detailed analysis of **why** Argentine provinces specifically adopted cascading taxation (vs. retail sales tax like US states)

**Closest existing work**: Spiller & Tommasi (2007) explain weak institutions generally, but don't explain Ingresos Brutos specifically

**Implication**: Need historical analysis of 1980s-1990s provincial tax choices

### Gap 3: Compensation Mechanism Design
**Missing**: Formal game-theoretic models of **optimal compensation design** (lump sum vs. gradual? Constitutional vs. external enforcement?)

**Closest existing work**: Roland (2000) discusses gradualism vs. big bang, but not in context of fiscal federalism specifically

**Implication**: Future research should model optimal compensation schedule for Ingresos Brutos elimination

## CONCLUSION

This bibliography demonstrates that **Argentina's Ingresos Brutos persistence is not an isolated anomaly**—it's a **textbook case** of the credible commitment problems analyzed by North & Weingast (1989), Kydland & Prescott (1977), and Spiller & Tommasi (2007).

The **game-theoretic diagnosis** is clear:

1. **Provinces maintain Ingresos Brutos as insurance** against federal opportunism (Riker 1964, Bednar 2009)
2. **Federal government can't credibly commit** to compensate provinces (North & Weingast 1989, Kydland & Prescott 1977)
3. **Weak institutions prevent intertemporal cooperation** (Spiller & Tommasi 2007)
4. **Provinces face individual-specific uncertainty** about compensation (Fernandez & Rodrik 1991)
5. **Constitutional constraints are missing** (Buchanan 1987, Wicksell 1896)

The **game-theoretic solution** requires:

1. **Constitutional amendment** guaranteeing compensation (North & Weingast 1989, Buchanan 1987)
2. **External enforcement** via IMF/IDB (Greif 1993, Dixit 1996)
3. **Gradual transition** with pilot provinces (Roland 2000, Dewatripont & Roland 1995)
4. **Multiple institutional safeguards** (Bednar 2009, Levy & Spiller 1994)

**Total estimated cost**: USD 28 billion over 10 years (Prompt 6 calculation)

**Expected efficiency gain**: 1.5-3% of GDP annually (Prompt 5 analysis)

**Game-theoretic prediction**: Hybrid approach (constitutional + external + gradual) changes equilibrium from **mutual defection** to **mutual cooperation**, making Ingresos Brutos elimination **politically feasible** for the first time since 1935.
