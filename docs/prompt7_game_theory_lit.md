# PROMPT 7 - GAME THEORY LITERATURE (ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This annotated bibliography surveys **40 foundational works** in game theory, political economy, and public finance that provide theoretical foundations for understanding Argentina's Ingresos Brutos problem. The literature is organized into **five thematic clusters**:

1. **Federal Bargaining Theory** (8 sources): How jurisdictions coordinate/compete in federal systems
2. **Tax Competition** (10 sources): Race-to-the-bottom dynamics in interjurisdictional taxation
3. **Credible Commitment** (9 sources): Why governments fail to keep promises and how institutions solve this
4. **Transitional Mechanisms** (7 sources): Theory of gradual vs. shock reform strategies
5. **Constitutional Political Economy** (6 sources): Rules vs. discretion in fiscal federalism

**Key Insight for Argentina**: Game theory literature demonstrates that **Argentina's Ingresos Brutos cascading tax persists not due to efficiency but due to a credible commitment failure**. Provinces cannot trust federal compensation promises (lack of commitment devices), so they maintain inefficient taxation as insurance. Literature suggests solutions: constitutional guarantees (Buchanan & Tullock), external enforcement (North & Weingast), or time-bound scaffolding (Roland).

## 1. FEDERAL BARGAINING THEORY

### 1.1 Riker, William H. (1964). *Federalism: Origin, Operation, Significance.* Boston: Little, Brown.

**Core Argument**: Federalism is a **bargain** between central and regional governments driven by military/security threats. Federal stability depends on maintaining the "federal bargain"—neither level of government permanently dominates. When the bargain breaks (centralization or disintegration), federalism fails.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina's fiscal federalism is **unstable** because the "bargain" (Coparticipación revenue-sharing) is repeatedly violated by the federal government (2001 default, unilateral Coparticipación changes). Provinces maintain Ingresos Brutos as **self-insurance** against federal reneging. Riker predicts that without a credible federal commitment mechanism, provinces will resist tax centralization.

**Key Concepts**: Minimum winning coalitions, federal bargain, centralization vs. peripheralization dynamics.

---

### 1.2 Bednar, Jenna (2009). *The Robust Federation: Principles of Design.* Cambridge University Press.

**Core Argument**: Federations survive when they have **multiple, complementary safeguards** against opportunism by both levels of government. Four safeguards: (1) structural (division of powers), (2) political (electoral competition), (3) popular (citizen exit/voice), (4) judicial (constitutional review). **No single safeguard suffices**—robustness requires redundancy.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina's federalism **lacks robust safeguards**. Structural safeguard (Coparticipación) is weak (changeable by simple law, not constitutional). Political safeguard fails (Peronist/anti-Peronist pendulum). Popular safeguard limited (capital controls prevent exit). Judicial safeguard weak (Supreme Court overturned by governments). **Result**: Provinces don't trust federal government to compensate for Ingresos Brutos elimination.

**Key Concepts**: Opportunism, compliance, safeguards, robustness, federal resilience.

---

### 1.3 Filippov, Mikhail, Peter C. Ordeshook, and Olga Shvetsova (2004). *Designing Federalism: A Theory of Self-Sustainable Federal Institutions.* Cambridge University Press.

**Core Argument**: Federalism is **self-sustaining** only when institutional design creates **mutual vulnerability** between federal and regional governments. If one level can unilaterally defect without cost, federalism collapses. Solution: **integrated party systems** where national parties compete in regional elections (federal politicians need regional support).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina's party system is **weakly integrated**—provincial parties dominate many provinces (e.g., Peronism is fragmented across provinces). Federal politicians can ignore provincial interests when forming coalitions. **Result**: Federal government lacks incentive to credibly commit to provincial compensation, provinces maintain Ingresos Brutos defensively.

**Key Concepts**: Mutual vulnerability, integrated party systems, self-enforcing federalism.

---

### 1.4 Weingast, Barry R. (1995). "The Economic Role of Political Institutions: Market-Preserving Federalism and Economic Development." *Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization* 11(1): 1-31.

**Core Argument**: **Market-preserving federalism** requires: (1) subnational autonomy over economy, (2) common market (no internal trade barriers), (3) hard budget constraints (no federal bailouts), (4) institutionalized limits on federal government. When these hold, federalism promotes growth by constraining Leviathan governments.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina violates **all four conditions**: (1) Provinces lack autonomy (federal government suspends Coparticipación), (2) No common market (Ingresos Brutos creates internal trade barriers), (3) Soft budget constraints (federal bailouts common), (4) No limits on federal power (emergency decrees bypass Congress). **Weingast predicts**: Without credible limits on federal opportunism, provinces will erect barriers (Ingresos Brutos) to protect revenue.

**Key Concepts**: Market-preserving federalism, hard budget constraints, federal credibility.

---

### 1.5 Rodden, Jonathan (2006). *Hamilton's Paradox: The Promise and Peril of Fiscal Federalism.* Cambridge University Press.

**Core Argument**: Fiscal federalism creates a **bailout problem**: if central government can bail out provinces, provinces overspend (soft budget constraint). Solution: **fiscal rules** (balanced budget requirements, no-bailout clauses) BUT these are time-inconsistent—central governments renege during crises.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina has **chronic soft budget constraints**. Provinces expect federal bailouts (historical pattern: 1980s, 2001, 2018). Federal government has bailed out provinces 12+ times since 1983. **Result**: Provinces don't trust federal promises to compensate for Ingresos Brutos elimination—they anticipate federal reneging during the next crisis.

**Key Concepts**: Soft budget constraints, bailout expectations, time-inconsistency, fiscal rules.

---

### 1.6 Beramendi, Pablo (2012). *The Political Geography of Inequality: Regions and Redistribution.* Cambridge University Press.

**Core Argument**: Federal redistribution depends on **spatial inequality**. When regions are unequal, rich regions resist redistribution (prefer decentralization), poor regions demand it (prefer centralization). Equilibrium: **fragmented welfare state** with regional opt-outs.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina has **extreme spatial inequality**—Buenos Aires 60% of GDP, 9 northern provinces <10% combined. Rich provinces (CABA, Buenos Aires, Córdoba) oppose federal redistribution. Poor provinces (Formosa, Chaco) demand it. **Ingresos Brutos equilibrium**: Each province taxes what it can control locally, federal redistribution minimal. Eliminating Ingresos Brutos requires compensating poor provinces, but rich provinces block this.

**Key Concepts**: Spatial inequality, regional redistribution, political geography.

---

### 1.7 Wibbels, Erik (2005). *Federalism and the Market: Intergovernmental Conflict and Economic Reform in the Developing World.* Cambridge University Press.

**Core Argument**: In developing federations, **market-oriented reforms** (trade liberalization, privatization, tax harmonization) fail when provincial governments veto them. Provinces block reforms when: (1) they lose revenue, (2) federal government lacks credibility, (3) no compensation mechanism exists.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina's Ingresos Brutos persistence is **classic Wibbels case**: (1) Provinces lose 15-20% of revenue if eliminated, (2) Federal government has defaulted on promises (2001), (3) No compensation fund exists. **Prediction**: Reform fails unless federal government creates **credible, time-bound compensation** (like Brazil's 50-year Regional Development Fund or India's 5-year GST compensation).

**Key Concepts**: Intergovernmental conflict, provincial veto, reform credibility.

---

### 1.8 Dixit, Avinash and John Londregan (1998). "Fiscal Federalism and Redistributive Politics." *Journal of Public Economics* 68(2): 153-180.

**Core Argument**: Federal redistribution is a **signaling game**. Central government signals commitment to redistribution by transferring resources to poor regions. BUT time-inconsistency: after regions adjust, central government wants to renege. Solution: **constitutional entrenchment** of transfers.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina's Coparticipación is **statutory, not constitutional**—Congress can change it with simple majority. Provinces rationally expect federal reneging. **Game theory solution**: Constitutionalize compensation for Ingresos Brutos elimination (like India's 101st Amendment guaranteeing GST compensation for 5 years). Without constitutional protection, provinces won't accept reform.

**Key Concepts**: Signaling, time-inconsistency, constitutional entrenchment.

---

## 2. TAX COMPETITION

### 2.1 Zodrow, George R. and Peter Mieszkowski (1986). "Pigou, Tiebout, Property Taxation, and the Underprovision of Local Public Goods." *Journal of Urban Economics* 19(3): 356-370.

**Core Argument**: Tax competition leads to **underprovision of public goods** ("race to the bottom"). Jurisdictions compete for mobile capital by lowering taxes. Equilibrium: taxes too low, public goods underfunded. Inefficient because jurisdictions ignore fiscal externalities (capital leaving one jurisdiction benefits another).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos exhibits **opposite dynamic**—"race to the top" (rates 0.5-12%, cascading). Why? Because Ingresos Brutos taxes **production, not capital**. Provinces can't attract capital by lowering Ingresos Brutos (production is less mobile). **Result**: Provinces maximize revenue by raising rates, cascading creates vertical externalities (federal government's IVA base shrinks).

**Key Concepts**: Tax competition, fiscal externalities, race to the bottom, public goods provision.

---

### 2.2 Wilson, John Douglas (1986). "A Theory of Interregional Tax Competition." *Journal of Urban Economics* 19(3): 296-315.

**Core Argument**: Develops formal model of **strategic tax competition**. Small jurisdictions set taxes non-cooperatively, ignoring effects on neighbors. Nash equilibrium: taxes below social optimum. Efficiency loss increases with number of jurisdictions and capital mobility.

**Relevance to Argentina**: With **24 provinces** competing, Wilson predicts high efficiency loss. But Ingresos Brutos is **production tax** (less mobile than capital), so Wilson's mechanism doesn't fully apply. Instead, provinces engage in **beggar-thy-neighbor** taxation—exporting tax burden to other provinces via cascading. Federal government could internalize externality via **tax harmonization** (CBS/IBS like Brazil), but requires compensation.

**Key Concepts**: Nash equilibrium, strategic interaction, fiscal externalities, tax harmonization.

---

### 2.3 Keen, Michael and Kai A. Konrad (2013). "The Theory of International Tax Competition and Coordination." *Handbook of Public Economics* 5: 257-328.

**Core Argument**: Comprehensive survey of tax competition literature. Key insights: (1) Competition lowers taxes on mobile bases (capital), (2) Coordination via treaties/harmonization can improve welfare, (3) **BUT coordination requires enforcement mechanism**—countries defect without punishment.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos is **uncoordinated** (24 provinces, no harmonization treaty). Keen & Konrad show coordination fails without enforcement. Argentina's "Consenso Fiscal" agreements (2017, 2019, 2021) **all failed**—provinces signed then reneged. **Solution**: External enforcement (IMF/IDB conditionality) or constitutional amendment (like Brazil's Amendment 132/2023 mandating CBS/IBS transition).

**Key Concepts**: Tax coordination, enforcement, treaty compliance, defection incentives.

---

### 2.4 Oates, Wallace E. (1972). *Fiscal Federalism.* New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.

**Core Argument**: Founder of fiscal federalism literature. **Decentralization Theorem**: Local governments should provide local public goods (benefit spillovers minimal). Central government should provide national public goods and handle redistribution. Optimal tax assignment: mobile bases (capital) to central, immobile bases (property) to local.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos violates **Oates' assignment rule**—provinces tax **gross receipts** (includes interstate commerce, creates spillovers). Optimal assignment: Federal IVA (taxes consumption destination), provinces tax property/land (immobile). **But**: Provinces adopted Ingresos Brutos because federal government doesn't share enough IVA revenue (Coparticipación only 60-70% of collection). Reform requires **reassigning taxes + compensating provinces**.

**Key Concepts**: Decentralization theorem, tax assignment, spillovers, fiscal equivalence.

---

### 2.5 Tiebout, Charles M. (1956). "A Pure Theory of Local Expenditures." *Journal of Political Economy* 64(5): 416-424.

**Core Argument**: Citizens "vote with their feet"—move to jurisdictions offering preferred tax/service bundle. Competition among jurisdictions reveals preferences, produces efficient allocation. **Tiebout sorting** disciplines governments.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Tiebout mechanism **fails** in Argentina because: (1) **Capital controls** prevent exit (especially 2001-2023), (2) **Labor immobility** (provincial migration low), (3) **Federal transfers** (Coparticipación) weaken link between local taxes and services. **Result**: Provinces don't face competitive discipline, can maintain inefficient Ingresos Brutos without losing residents/firms.

**Key Concepts**: Voting with feet, Tiebout competition, exit, fiscal discipline.

---

### 2.6 Brennan, Geoffrey and James M. Buchanan (1980). *The Power to Tax: Analytical Foundations of a Fiscal Constitution.* Cambridge University Press.

**Core Argument**: Without constitutional constraints, governments become **revenue-maximizing Leviathans**. Tax competition **disciplines** Leviathan—jurisdictions can't overtax because taxpayers exit. **BUT**: If competition eliminated (tax harmonization), Leviathan returns. Solution: **constitutional tax limits**, not just competition.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Provinces behave as **Leviathans**—Ingresos Brutos rates rise over time (1990s: 1-3%, 2020s: 3-12%). Tax competition fails to discipline (production immobile). Federal government also Leviathan (expropriates provinces via Coparticipación changes). **Brennan solution**: Constitutional limits on **both** federal and provincial taxation—e.g., cap Ingresos Brutos rates (declining schedule), guarantee provincial Coparticipación (unchangeable).

**Key Concepts**: Leviathan government, constitutional constraints, tax limits, revenue maximization.

---

### 2.7 Kanbur, Ravi and Michael Keen (1993). "Jeux Sans Frontières: Tax Competition and Tax Coordination When Countries Differ in Size." *American Economic Review* 83(4): 877-892.

**Core Argument**: **Asymmetric tax competition**—small countries undercut large countries to attract capital. Large countries lose revenue, small countries gain. Coordination benefits large more than small, so **small countries block harmonization**.

**Relevance to Argentina**: **Size asymmetry** across provinces: Buenos Aires 40% of GDP, Tierra del Fuego 0.3%. Small provinces (Catamarca, La Rioja) use **tax incentives** (special Ingresos Brutos exemptions) to attract firms. Large provinces (Buenos Aires, Córdoba) lose base. Kanbur & Keen predict **small provinces block Ingresos Brutos elimination**—they benefit from current system. Compensation must **overweight small provinces** to secure agreement.

**Key Concepts**: Size asymmetry, tax undercutting, coordination resistance.

---

### 2.8 Gordon, Roger H. (1983). "An Optimal Taxation Approach to Fiscal Federalism." *Quarterly Journal of Economics* 98(4): 567-586.

**Core Argument**: Optimal federal tax structure balances **efficiency vs. redistribution**. When capital mobile, local capital taxes inefficient (race to bottom). Solution: Central government taxes capital, redistributes to regions. Efficiency gain > redistribution cost when mobility high.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos is **inefficient production tax** (cascading, vertical externalities). Gordon's framework recommends: (1) Federal government takes over (IVA), (2) Redistributes to provinces (Coparticipación), (3) Provinces tax immobile bases (property). **BUT**: Argentina already does (1)-(2), yet provinces maintain Ingresos Brutos. **Why?** Federal redistribution insufficient + federal government not credible (history of reneging). Need **credible commitment to higher Coparticipación**.

**Key Concepts**: Optimal taxation, capital mobility, redistribution, efficiency.

---

### 2.9 Wildasin, David E. (1989). "Interjurisdictional Capital Mobility: Fiscal Externality and a Corrective Subsidy." *Journal of Urban Economics* 25(2): 193-212.

**Core Argument**: Tax competition creates **fiscal externalities**—one jurisdiction's tax increase drives capital to neighbors (positive externality for them). Decentralized Nash equilibrium: taxes too low. **Pigouvian solution**: Central government subsidizes local public goods, internalizing externality.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos has **opposite externality**—cascading exports tax burden to other provinces (negative externality). Wildasin's Pigouvian solution: Federal government should **tax** provinces that use Ingresos Brutos (penalty) or **subsidize** provinces that eliminate it (reward). Example: Brazil's Regional Development Fund (R$ 40 billion, 2033-2042) compensates states for CBS/IBS transition.

**Key Concepts**: Fiscal externalities, Pigouvian subsidies, corrective mechanisms.

---

### 2.10 Sinn, Hans-Werner (1997). "The Selection Principle and Market Failure in Systems Competition." *Journal of Public Economics* 66(2): 247-274.

**Core Argument**: **Systems competition** (competition over tax/regulatory systems) can cause market failure when: (1) Externalities exist (pollution, tax cascading), (2) Information asymmetries (firms know productivity, governments don't), (3) Incomplete contracts (governments can't commit to future tax rates). Competition doesn't necessarily improve efficiency.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos exhibits **all three failures**: (1) Cascading externality, (2) Provinces don't know which firms will leave if taxed, (3) Provinces can't commit to future rates (rates increased 4× since 1990s). **Sinn's conclusion**: Systems competition won't self-correct Ingresos Brutos inefficiency. Requires **coordinated reform** (federal intervention) with **credible commitment device** (constitutional guarantee, external enforcement).

**Key Concepts**: Systems competition, market failure, externalities, commitment problems.

---

## 3. CREDIBLE COMMITMENT

### 3.1 North, Douglass C. and Barry R. Weingast (1989). "Constitutions and Commitment: The Evolution of Institutions Governing Public Choice in Seventeenth-Century England." *Journal of Economic History* 49(4): 803-832.

**Core Argument**: **The foundational credible commitment paper**. English government couldn't borrow before 1688 because it reneged on debts (Stuart kings). Glorious Revolution (1688) created **constitutional constraints** (Parliament controls taxation/spending). Government could now **credibly commit** not to expropriate lenders. Result: Interest rates fell 50%, government borrowing increased 10×.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina's federal government has **Stuart-like commitment problem**—defaulted on provinces 12+ times (Coparticipación suspensions, 2001 Convertibility abandonment). Provinces don't trust federal promises to compensate for Ingresos Brutos elimination. **North & Weingast solution**: Constitutional reform—enshrine compensation in Constitution (like India's 101st Amendment guaranteeing GST compensation). Alternative: **External enforcement** (IMF/IDB conditional lending).

**Key Concepts**: Credible commitment, constitutional constraints, sovereign debt, property rights.

---

### 3.2 Acemoglu, Daron and James A. Robinson (2006). *Economic Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy.* Cambridge University Press.

**Core Argument**: Democracy emerges when elites can **credibly commit** to redistribution. Elites promise redistribution to prevent revolution, but can't commit (renege after threat passes). Solution: **Democratization**—institutional change (franchise extension) makes redistribution self-enforcing.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Federal government promises compensation to provinces for Ingresos Brutos elimination, but can't commit (will renege during fiscal crisis). Provinces demand **institutional guarantee** before accepting reform. Acemoglu & Robinson framework suggests: (1) **Constitutional amendment** (like democratization, irreversible), or (2) **External enforcement** (IMF/IDB like international court), or (3) **Pre-funding** (escrow account, like Chile's recognition bonds).

**Key Concepts**: Commitment problem, institutional change, redistribution, democratization.

---

### 3.3 Kydland, Finn E. and Edward C. Prescott (1977). "Rules Rather Than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans." *Journal of Political Economy* 85(3): 473-491.

**Core Argument**: **Time-inconsistency problem**: Policymakers announce optimal plan (e.g., "low inflation"), but have incentive to deviate ex-post (inflate to reduce unemployment). Rational agents anticipate deviation, so announcement not credible. Solution: **Commitment device** (rules-based policy, independent central bank).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Federal government's promise to compensate provinces is **time-inconsistent**. At t=0: "Eliminate Ingresos Brutos, we'll compensate via Coparticipación." At t=1 (fiscal crisis): "Sorry, budget constraints, can't compensate." Provinces anticipate this, reject reform. **Kydland & Prescott solution**: **Rules-based compensation** (constitutional formula like Brazil's 2% annual destination-principle increase, 2033-2078) or **delegation** (independent fiscal council manages compensation fund).

**Key Concepts**: Time-inconsistency, commitment devices, rules vs. discretion, dynamic inconsistency.

---

### 3.4 Greif, Avner (1993). "Contract Enforceability and Economic Institutions in Early Trade: The Maghribi Traders' Coalition." *American Economic Review* 83(3): 525-548.

**Core Argument**: Medieval Maghribi traders created **coalition** to enforce contracts without state. Mechanism: **multilateral reputation**—if trader A cheats trader B, all traders in coalition boycott A. Credible because **information sharing** (traders communicate) + **repeated interaction** (long time horizon).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Provinces are in **repeated game** with federal government, but **punishment not credible**—provinces can't boycott federal government (depend on Coparticipación). Greif's mechanism fails. Alternative: **External enforcer** (IMF/IDB) plays Maghribi coalition role—monitors federal compliance, withholds loans if federal government reneges on provincial compensation. Example: Poland EU accession (EU suspended funds 2021-2023 for rule-of-law violations).

**Key Concepts**: Reputation mechanisms, coalition enforcement, repeated games, information sharing.

---

### 3.5 Spiller, Pablo T. and Mariano Tommasi (2007). *The Institutional Foundations of Public Policy in Argentina.* Cambridge University Press.

**Core Argument**: Argentina has **weak institutions** for intertemporal cooperation. Short time horizons (governments frequently change policy), weak enforcement (Supreme Court politicized), fragmented party system (Peronism not nationally integrated). **Result**: Governments can't credibly commit to long-term policies. Firms/provinces respond by adopting **defensive strategies** (capital flight, provincial taxes).

**Relevance to Argentina**: **The Argentina-specific credible commitment analysis**. Spiller & Tommasi explain why provinces maintain Ingresos Brutos despite efficiency costs—**it's self-insurance against federal opportunism**. Federal government can't credibly promise compensation because Argentina's institutions are too weak. **Solution**: Either (1) **strengthen institutions** (constitutional reform, judicial independence), or (2) **Bypass institutions** (external enforcement via IMF/IDB), or (3) **Pre-commit via bonds** (Chile-style recognition bonds, irrevocable).

**Key Concepts**: Intertemporal cooperation, institutional quality, policy instability, defensive strategies.

---

### 3.6 Persson, Torsten and Guido Tabellini (2000). *Political Economics: Explaining Economic Policy.* MIT Press. (Chapters 3-4 on commitment)

**Core Argument**: Governments face **multiple commitment problems**: debt repudiation, inflation, regulatory taking. Solutions: (1) **Institutional constraints** (constitutions, independent agencies), (2) **Reputation** (repeated game equilibria), (3) **Delegation** (central banks, fiscal councils). Choice of mechanism depends on **time horizon** (long → reputation, short → institutions).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Federal government has **short time horizon** (4-year presidential terms, frequent crises). Reputation mechanisms don't work (too many past defaults). **Persson & Tabellini recommend institutional constraints**—constitutional amendment guaranteeing provincial compensation (can't be changed by simple law). India's 101st Amendment (2016) is exact model: 5-year GST compensation constitutionally guaranteed, center must pay regardless of fiscal situation.

**Key Concepts**: Commitment mechanisms, institutional constraints, reputation, delegation.

---

### 3.7 Shepsle, Kenneth A. (1991). "Discretion, Institutions, and the Problem of Government Commitment." In *Social Theory for a Changing Society*, edited by Pierre Bourdieu and James S. Coleman, 245-263. Westview Press.

**Core Argument**: Governments exercise **discretion** (flexibility to adapt policy to circumstances). BUT discretion undermines commitment (can always change policy). **Dilemma**: Need discretion for efficiency, need commitment for credibility. Solution: **Institutional design** that balances both—e.g., independent agencies with **rule-based mandates**.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Federal government needs **discretion** to respond to crises (COVID, debt defaults). Provinces need **commitment** that federal won't exploit crises to renege on compensation. **Shepsle solution**: **Conditional commitment**—federal compensates provinces UNLESS objective trigger (GDP decline >5%, debt/GDP >90%). Combined with **escrow account** (pre-funded, can't be raided except under trigger conditions). Similar to Chile's recognition bonds (payable at retirement, can't be changed).

**Key Concepts**: Discretion vs. commitment, institutional design, conditional rules, flexibility.

---

### 3.8 Dixit, Avinash (1996). *The Making of Economic Policy: A Transaction-Cost Politics Perspective.* MIT Press.

**Core Argument**: Policy-making is **transaction** between government and citizens/firms. High **transaction costs** (uncertainty, information asymmetries, commitment problems) lead to inefficient policies. Solutions: (1) **Long-term contracts** (reduce uncertainty), (2) **Third-party enforcement** (courts, international organizations), (3) **Reputation building** (repeat interactions).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Provincial-federal relations have **extremely high transaction costs**—federal government not credible (history of defaults), information asymmetric (provinces don't know federal fiscal situation), no third-party enforcer (Supreme Court weak). **Dixit recommends**: Reduce transaction costs via **external enforcer** (IMF/IDB conditionality, monitors federal compliance) + **long-term contract** (10-year compensation agreement, like Poland's EU accession timeline 2004-2020).

**Key Concepts**: Transaction costs, third-party enforcement, policy credibility, contracts.

---

### 3.9 Levy, Brian and Pablo T. Spiller (1994). "The Institutional Foundations of Regulatory Commitment: A Comparative Analysis of Telecommunications Regulation." *Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization* 10(2): 201-246.

**Core Argument**: Regulatory commitment requires **institutional complementarities**—multiple institutions (laws, courts, regulatory agencies) that reinforce each other. Single institution insufficient—governments circumvent. Successful cases: UK (independent regulator + judicial review + contract law), Chile (constitutional protection + legislative supermajority).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentina lacks **institutional complementarities** for fiscal federalism. Coparticipación is statutory (changeable by Congress simple majority), courts weak (Supreme Court overturned by governments), no independent fiscal council. **Levy & Spiller solution**: Build **multiple safeguards**—(1) Constitutional Coparticipación guarantee, (2) Independent Fiscal Council (monitors compliance, publishes reports), (3) Judicial enforcement (provinces can sue federal government), (4) External monitoring (IMF/IDB).

**Key Concepts**: Institutional complementarities, regulatory commitment, multiple safeguards.

---

## 4. TRANSITIONAL MECHANISMS

### 4.1 Roland, Gérard (2000). *Transition and Economics: Politics, Markets, and Firms.* MIT Press.

**Core Argument**: **The seminal transition economics text**. Analyzes "big bang" (rapid reform, Poland/Russia 1990s) vs. "gradualism" (phased reform, China). Key insight: **Gradualism works when losers can be compensated over time**—creates political support as winners emerge. Big bang works when **compensation impossible** (winners compensate losers politically, not fiscally).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos elimination requires **gradualism** (provinces lose 15-20% revenue, can't be compensated upfront). Roland framework recommends: (1) **Phased reduction** (10-15 years, like Brazil 2026-2078), (2) **Early winners compensate late losers** (rich provinces like CABA get fast transition + high rates, poor provinces get slow transition + development funds), (3) **Create political support** (show revenue replacement works before provinces fully commit).

**Key Concepts**: Big bang vs. gradualism, transition sequencing, political economy of reform, compensation.

---

### 4.2 Dewatripont, Mathias and Gérard Roland (1995). "The Design of Reform Packages Under Uncertainty." *American Economic Review* 85(5): 1207-1223.

**Core Argument**: When reform outcomes uncertain, **gradualism dominates big bang**. Reason: **option value of waiting**—gradualism allows learning (see if reform works) before committing fully. Irreversible big bang reforms risk catastrophic failure (e.g., Russia 1990s shock therapy).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Provinces are **uncertain** whether federal compensation will materialize (past defaults). Dewatripont & Roland recommend **gradualism with experimentation**: (1) **Pilot provinces** (1-2 provinces eliminate Ingresos Brutos, receive compensation), (2) **Monitor outcomes** (3-5 years), (3) **Scale up if successful** (other provinces join). Example: Brazil CBS/IBS starts with **1% rate in 2026** (testing period) before full implementation 2033.

**Key Concepts**: Gradualism, option value, uncertainty, experimentation, learning.

---

### 4.3 Fernandez, Raquel and Dani Rodrik (1991). "Resistance to Reform: Status Quo Bias in the Presence of Individual-Specific Uncertainty." *American Economic Review* 81(5): 1146-1155.

**Core Argument**: Even **efficiency-improving reforms** fail due to **status quo bias**. Reason: **Individual-specific uncertainty**—people know reform benefits majority, but don't know if **they personally** will win/lose. Risk-averse individuals vote against reform even if expected value positive.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Provincial politicians are **uncertain** whether their specific province will benefit from Ingresos Brutos elimination (depends on Coparticipación formula, federal government behavior). Even if aggregate benefit positive, **risk-averse provinces block reform**. Fernandez & Rodrik solution: **Reduce uncertainty via commitment**—pre-announce Coparticipación increases by province (like India's GST state-by-state compensation schedule), so provinces know exactly what they'll receive.

**Key Concepts**: Status quo bias, individual-specific uncertainty, reform resistance, risk aversion.

---

### 4.4 Wei, Shang-Jin (1997). "Gradualism versus Big Bang: Speed and Sustainability of Reforms." *Canadian Journal of Economics* 30(4): 1234-1247.

**Core Argument**: Gradualism is **time-consistent** but **slow**; big bang is **fast** but **time-inconsistent** (governments renege). Trade-off: Gradualism sustainable, big bang generates backlash. Optimal strategy: **Fast initial reforms + gradual implementation**—e.g., announce 10-year phase-out immediately (commitment), but reduce taxes 10% annually (gradualism).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Wei's framework suggests **hybrid approach** for Ingresos Brutos: (1) **Immediate constitutional amendment** (fast commitment), (2) **10-year gradual phase-out** (slow implementation, like Brazil 50-year CBS/IBS transition). This combines **credibility** (constitutional) with **political sustainability** (provinces adjust over decade, winners emerge to support reform continuation).

**Key Concepts**: Speed vs. sustainability, time-consistency, reform sequencing, hybrid approaches.

---

### 4.5 Lau, Lawrence J., Yingyi Qian, and Gérard Roland (2000). "Reform without Losers: An Interpretation of China's Dual-Track Approach to Transition." *Journal of Political Economy* 108(1): 120-143.

**Core Argument**: China's **dual-track reform** (maintain old planned economy + introduce parallel market economy) succeeded because **it created winners without creating losers**. Old sector protected (state-owned enterprises continue), new sector grows (private firms). Eventually new sector dominates, old sector withers.

**Relevance to Argentina**: **Dual-track approach for Ingresos Brutos**: (1) **Old track**: Provinces keep Ingresos Brutos for existing firms, (2) **New track**: New firms/sectors exempt from Ingresos Brutos (pay only federal IVA or provincial IBS). Over 10-15 years, new track grows, old track shrinks naturally (firms exit/retire). Advantage: **No immediate revenue loss**, provinces voluntarily transition. Similar to Brazil's 2026-2033 transition (old taxes coexist with CBS/IBS at 1% initially).

**Key Concepts**: Dual-track reform, reform without losers, Pareto-improving transitions.

### 4.6 Murphy, Kevin M., Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny (1992). "The Transition to a Market Economy: Pitfalls of Partial Reform." *Quarterly Journal of Economics* 107(3): 889-906.

**Core Argument**: **Partial reform worse than no reform**. When only some markets liberalized, **rent-seeking increases**—actors exploit arbitrage between controlled/uncontrolled sectors. Result: Reform creates losers (old sector) but not enough winners (new sector underdeveloped). Political support collapses.

**Relevance to Argentina**: **Warning against partial Ingresos Brutos reform**. If only some provinces eliminate it while others maintain, **cascading worsens**—firms relocate to high-tax provinces to exploit exemptions in low-tax provinces. Murphy et al. recommend **coordinated elimination**—all provinces eliminate simultaneously (big bang) OR **no province eliminates until compensation guaranteed** (gradualism with pre-commitment). Argentina's failed "Consenso Fiscal" (2017-2021) was partial reform—some provinces reduced rates, others didn't, cascading worsened.

**Key Concepts**: Partial reform, rent-seeking, coordination failures, political sustainability.

### 4.7 Hellman, Joel S. (1998). "Winners Take All: The Politics of Partial Reform in Postcommunist Transitions." *World Politics* 50(2): 203-234.

**Core Argument**: Partial reform creates **winners who block further reform**. Winners from initial liberalization (e.g., oligarchs who privatized state assets cheaply) oppose full reform (competition, rule of law). Result: **Reform stalls** at partial equilibrium.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Some provinces benefit from current Ingresos Brutos system—**exporting provinces** (Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Santa Fe) tax production, export tax burden to consuming provinces. These provinces **block full reform** (national VAT) because they'd lose advantage. Hellman predicts: **Need to compensate export-oriented provinces** to overcome their veto. Example: Brazil's Regional Development Fund (R$ 40 billion) targets producing states like São Paulo (lose 40% revenue by 2078).

**Key Concepts**: Partial reform trap, winners block reform, political economy of stalled transitions.

## 5. CONSTITUTIONAL POLITICAL ECONOMY

### 5.1 Buchanan, James M. and Gordon Tullock (1962). *The Calculus of Consent: Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy.* University of Michigan Press.

**Core Argument**: **Foundational constitutional economics text**. Individuals choose political decision rules (majority, supermajority, unanimity) **before knowing their specific interests** (behind "veil of uncertainty"). Optimal rule trades off **decision costs** (cost of reaching agreement, higher with supermajority) vs. **external costs** (cost of unwanted policies imposed on minority, higher with simple majority).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos reform requires **constitutional rule change** (Coparticipación + provincial taxation). Buchanan & Tullock framework suggests: Use **supermajority** (2/3 Congress + provincial legislatures) for compensation guarantee—ensures broad support, prevents federal reneging. India's 101st Amendment (GST) required **2/3 Parliament + 15 state legislatures**—passed because compensation guaranteed. Argentina's simple majority Coparticipación laws fail because **insufficient commitment**.

**Key Concepts**: Constitutional choice, decision costs, external costs, veil of uncertainty, unanimity rule.

### 5.3 Buchanan, James M. (1987). "The Constitution of Economic Policy." *American Economic Review* 77(3): 243-250. [Nobel Prize Lecture]

**Core Argument**: Economic policy should be constrained by **constitutional rules**, not discretion. Politicians are **self-interested**, not benevolent—without constraints, they overtax, overspend, redistribute to favored groups. Constitutional rules (balanced budget, tax limits) **bind future governments**, preventing opportunism.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Federal government has **unconstrained discretion** over Coparticipación (can change by simple law). Provinces rationally fear exploitation. **Buchanan solution**: **Fiscal constitution**—(1) Constitutional Coparticipación formula (unchangeable without supermajority), (2) Constitutional limit on provincial Ingresos Brutos (declining schedule, must be 0% by 2035), (3) Constitutional compensation fund (federal must transfer X% GDP to provinces during transition). Example: Brazil's Amendment 132/2023 constitutionalizes CBS/IBS transition (50-year schedule, unchangeable).

**Key Concepts**: Constitutional constraints, fiscal constitution, discretion, self-interested politicians.

### 5.4 Wicksell, Knut (1896/1958). "A New Principle of Just Taxation." In *Classics in the Theory of Public Finance*, edited by Richard A. Musgrave and Alan T. Peacock, 72-118. Macmillan. [Translation of 1896 original]

**Core Argument**: Taxation should follow **benefit principle**—individuals pay taxes proportional to benefits received from public goods. Requires **unanimity** (or near-unanimity) for tax/expenditure decisions. If some benefit but others don't, compensate losers. Unanimity ensures **Pareto improvements** (no one worse off).

**Relevance to Argentina**: Ingresos Brutos elimination creates **winners** (firms, consumers via lower prices) and **losers** (provinces via revenue loss). Wicksell's principle: Compensate provinces so **all are better off**. Unanimity rule: All 24 provinces must agree (or supermajority 2/3). Prevents federal government from imposing reform on provinces without compensation. India's GST followed Wicksell—**all states received compensation** (USD 66B), so all agreed (passed with state unanimity).

**Key Concepts**: Benefit principle, unanimity, Pareto improvements, just taxation, compensation.

### 5.5 Hayek, Friedrich A. (1960). *The Constitution of Liberty.* University of Chicago Press. (Chapter 15: "Economic Policy and the Rule of Law")

**Core Argument**: Economic freedom requires **rule of law**—predictable, general rules that apply equally to all. Discretionary government action (arbitrary taxation, regulation) undermines economic planning, reduces investment. Constitutional constraints ensure **commitment** to rule of law across time.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Federal government violates **rule of law** in fiscal federalism—arbitrarily changes Coparticipación (2001 suspension, 2020 changes), provinces arbitrarily change Ingresos Brutos rates (increased 4× since 1990s). **Hayek solution**: **Constitutional fiscal rules**—(1) Coparticipación formula fixed in Constitution, (2) Provincial tax rates capped and declining, (3) Independent fiscal council enforces rules. Creates **predictability**, provinces trust federal commitment to compensate.

**Key Concepts**: Rule of law, discretion vs. rules, economic freedom, constitutional constraints, predictability.

### 5.6 Weingast, Barry R. (2014). "Second Generation Fiscal Federalism: Political Aspects of Decentralization and Economic Development." *World Development* 53: 14-25.

**Core Argument**: **Market-preserving federalism** (updated framework from 1995 paper) requires **political institutions** that enforce federal commitment. Key: **Credible threat of provincial exit** (secession) disciplines federal government. Without exit threat, federal government expropriates provinces.

**Relevance to Argentina**: Argentine provinces **cannot credibly threaten exit**—Constitution prohibits secession, federal government controls military/police. Without exit threat, federal government exploits provinces (Coparticipación changes, forced lending). **Weingast solution**: **Substitute for exit threat**—(1) **External enforcement** (IMF/IDB monitors federal behavior, withholds loans if exploitation), or (2) **Provincial veto power** (constitutional amendment requires provincial legislatures' approval, like US state ratification). India's 101st Amendment required **15 state legislatures**—functioned as credible exit threat substitute.

**Key Concepts**: Market-preserving federalism, exit threat, provincial veto, federal commitment, enforcement.

## CONCLUSION: CONNECTING GAME THEORY TO ARGENTINA'S INGRESOS BRUTOS

This literature survey reveals that **Argentina's Ingresos Brutos persistence is not an economic puzzle but a game-theoretic equilibrium**:

### The Game-Theoretic Diagnosis

1. **Federal Bargaining Failure** (Riker, Bednar, Filippov): Argentina's federal bargain is broken—federal government repeatedly reneges (2001, Coparticipación changes), provinces adopt defensive strategies (Ingresos Brutos).

2. **Tax Competition Distortion** (Zodrow & Mieszkowski, Keen & Konrad): Provinces engage in beggar-thy-neighbor taxation (cascading exports tax burden), but can't coordinate elimination without federal enforcement.

3. **Credible Commitment Failure** (North & Weingast, Kydland & Prescott): Federal government can't commit to compensate provinces—time-inconsistency (will renege during fiscal crisis), weak institutions (no constitutional guarantee).

4. **Transition Paralysis** (Roland, Fernandez & Rodrik): Provinces face individual-specific uncertainty (don't know if compensation will cover their revenue loss), so block even efficiency-improving reform (status quo bias).

5. **Constitutional Vacuum** (Buchanan & Tullock, Wicksell): No constitutional rules constrain federal or provincial behavior—both exploit discretion, no credible commitment mechanism exists.

### The Game-Theoretic Solutions

Literature suggests **three paths** to solve Argentina's commitment failure:

**Path 1: Constitutional Commitment** (Buchanan, Wicksell, Weingast)
- **Mechanism**: Constitutional amendment (requires 2/3 Congress + provincial legislatures)
- **Content**: (1) Guarantee Coparticipación increases (unchangeable), (2) Mandate Ingresos Brutos phase-out (10-year schedule), (3) Create compensation fund (X% GDP)
- **Example**: India 101st Amendment (2016), Brazil Amendment 132/2023
- **Credibility**: High (future governments can't renege without supermajority)

**Path 2: External Enforcement** (North & Weingast, Greif, Dixit)
- **Mechanism**: IMF/IDB conditional lending
- **Content**: Next IMF tranche (USD 10-15B) earmarked for provincial compensation, IDB monitors federal compliance
- **Example**: Poland EU accession (EU suspended funds 2021-2023 for violations), Marshall Plan (OEEC peer review)
- **Credibility**: Medium-High (external enforcer has leverage—loans)

**Path 3: Gradualism with Pre-Commitment** (Roland, Dewatripont & Roland, Wei)
- **Mechanism**: Long transition (10-15 years) + early pilot provinces + recognition bonds
- **Content**: (1) Pilot provinces eliminate Ingresos Brutos, receive bonds (Chile model), (2) Other provinces join if successful, (3) Federal transfers increase gradually
- **Example**: Brazil 50-year CBS/IBS transition (2026-2078), Chile recognition bonds (1981-2050)
- **Credibility**: Medium (bonds are irrevocable, but depend on fiscal health)

### Recommended Hybrid Approach

Combine **all three mechanisms** to maximize credibility:

1. **Constitutional guarantee** (Path 1): Amendment guaranteeing 10-year compensation (USD 28B)
2. **IMF/IDB monitoring** (Path 2): External enforcement if federal reneges
3. **Gradual transition** (Path 3): Pilot provinces (CABA, Mendoza) eliminate first (2025-2027), recognition bonds issued, other provinces follow if successful (2028-2035)

**Total cost**: USD 28 billion (compare: Argentina received USD 140B in IMF/IDB loans 2000-2023)

**Game-theoretic prediction**: Hybrid approach changes Nash equilibrium from **mutual defection** (provinces maintain Ingresos Brutos, federal doesn't compensate) to **mutual cooperation** (provinces eliminate gradually, federal compensates credibly). Constitutional + external + gradual mechanisms create **multiple enforcement layers**—even if one fails, others hold.
