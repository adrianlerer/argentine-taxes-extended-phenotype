## Comparison Methodology: India vs. Argentina

**Adjustment for Comparability**:

1. **Federal Structure**:
   - **India**: 29 states + 7 union territories (36 jurisdictions)
   - **Argentina**: 23 provinces + 1 autonomous city (24 jurisdictions)
   - **Similarity**: Both federal systems with constitutionally protected state/provincial powers

2. **Revenue Guarantee**:
   - **India**: 14% annual growth guaranteed (constitutional)
   - **Argentina**: No equivalent guarantee (IMF/IDB conditionalities = political, not legal)

3. **Compensation Funding**:
   - **India**: Dedicated cess on luxury/sin goods (₹4.8 lakh crore over 5 years)
   - **Argentina**: No dedicated fund (general budget + external loans)

4. **Currency Conversion**:
   - All USD figures use annual average exchange rates (RBI official)
   - Nominal values (not PPP-adjusted)

5. **Time Period**:
   - **India GST compensation**: July 2017-June 2022 (5 years)
   - **Argentina Ingresos Brutos reform attempts**: 2000, 2018, 2022, 2025 (all failed)

## Key Differences from Argentina Data

**India GST Compensation**:
- ✅ **Constitutional protection**: 101st Amendment guarantees compensation
- ✅ **Dedicated funding source**: Cess on luxury/sin goods
- ✅ **100% compliance**: All states received guaranteed compensation
- ✅ **Transparent governance**: GST Council with public records
- ✅ **Successful transition**: 15 states self-reliant by 2022

**Argentina Ingresos Brutos Reform** (see Research Output #3):
- ❌ **No constitutional protection**: Only IMF/IDB conditionalities (political)
- ❌ **No dedicated fund**: General budget + external loans
- ❌ **0-22% compliance**: Provinces block reform (no compensation mechanism)
- ❌ **Ad-hoc negotiations**: No institutionalized federal-provincial council
- ❌ **Chronic failure**: Reform attempted 2000, 2018, 2022, 2025 (all failed)

**Core Lesson**: India's compensation mechanism succeeded because it provided **credible commitment** (constitutional + dedicated funding). Argentina's reform attempts fail because provinces have **no guarantee** of revenue replacement.
