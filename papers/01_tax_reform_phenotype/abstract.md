This paper applies evolutionary legal theory to explain why Argentina's tax system has operated for 93 years in continuous violation of Article 75 inc. 2 of the National Constitution, which requires national direct taxes to be established "for determinate time."

**Research question**: Why do structural tax reforms systematically fail in Argentina despite 29 years of constitutional mandate (Transitional Clause 6, 1994 Constitutional Reform) requiring a new federal revenue-sharing law?

**Method**: We combine historical analysis of primary sources (1853-2025), quantitative fiscal data (2010-2024), genealogical analysis of Supreme Court precedents (RootFinder Protocol), and international comparative analysis (USA, Brazil, Mexico).

**Central finding**: Argentina's tax system is not a rational contemporary design but the **extended phenotype** of a 1932 constitutional mutation (Law 11,682 - income tax) that violated the constitutional requirement of temporality by becoming permanent. This mutation created an **Evolutionarily Stable Equilibrium (ESE)** where five institutional actors (AFIP, dependent provinces, tax professionals, national government, Supreme Court) have convergent incentives to maintain the status quo despite its constitutional illegitimacy.

**Theoretical contribution**: We demonstrate empirically three predictions of extended phenotype theory: (1) legal norms generate persistent phenotypes beyond their original function, (2) legal transplants fail without constitutional formalization, and (3) ESE resist reform even when suboptimal.

**Policy implication**: Reform requires either constitutional amendment (politically unfeasible) or exogenous crisis catalyst. Probability of comprehensive reform 2025-2027: <2% (Bayesian estimate).

**Comparative anomaly**: Argentina is the ONLY federal case where national income tax operates 93 years WITHOUT constitutional reform (vs. USA Amendment XVI, 1913).
