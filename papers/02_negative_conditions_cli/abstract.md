# Negative Conditions and Constitutional Lock-in: Abstract for SSRN

## Abstract

This paper explains why Argentina has achieved **0% success rate** in structural labor reforms (1994-2024) despite 60+ legislative attempts, while Brazil, Spain, and Chile successfully reformed their labor markets during the same period.

**Research question**: Why does Article 14 bis of the Argentine National Constitution, designed to protect workers' rights, create a **structural impossibility** of labor reform?

**Method**: We analyze 60+ reform attempts (1994-2024) using legislative tracking, Supreme Court jurisprudence analysis (RootFinder Protocol), and comparative analysis with successful reforms (Brazil Temer 2017, Spain Rajoy 2012, Chile Piñera 2016).

**Central finding**: Art. 14 bis creates "negative conditions" — constitutional requirements that NO norm may violate existing labor protections. Combined with: (1) **ultraactivity doctrine** (collective agreements survive indefinitely until replaced), (2) federal system where provinces can block, (3) Supreme Court deference to unions, this generates a **quadruple constitutional lock** that makes reform structurally impossible without constitutional amendment.

**Theoretical contribution**: We demonstrate how constitutional clauses with progressive intent (social rights protection) generate **evolutionarily stable equilibria (ESE)** that block adaptation to changing economic conditions. Art. 14 bis is not a "failure" but a successful **anti-reform mechanism** — it works exactly as designed.

**Comparative insight**: Brazil/Spain/Chile reformed because they lacked one or more elements of Argentina's quadruple lock. Brazil amended Constitution (1998), Spain used economic crisis (2012), Chile had weak union veto power.

**Connection to broader research**: This paper identifies the **same pattern** as our tax reform analysis — constitutional design creating irreversible lock-in. Argentina faces recurrent trilemma: Constitutionality vs. Economic Efficiency vs. Social Protection.

This paper complements "Tax Reform as Extended Phenotype" by demonstrating that Argentina's constitutional design systematically creates irreversible institutional lock-ins across multiple policy domains. Both papers apply the extended phenotype framework to analyze why well-intentioned constitutional provisions generate perverse long-term consequences.
