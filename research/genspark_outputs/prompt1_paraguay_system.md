## Executive Summary

Paraguay operates one of the simplest and lowest tax systems in Latin America, with a **14.5% tax-to-GDP ratio** (2023), featuring flat 10% rates for corporate (IRE) and personal income (IRP) taxes, and 10% VAT (IVA). This territorial taxation system collects approximately **USD 5-6 billion annually** (2020-2024), relying primarily on consumption taxes (37.5% of total revenue). The system is administered by the Subsecretaría de Estado de Tributación (SET), which has undergone significant digitalization since 2017 with mandatory e-invoicing (SIFEN system).

## 3. TAX ADMINISTRATION

### 3.1 Collection Agency

**Subsecretaría de Estado de Tributación (SET)**[^15]
- Part of Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas (MEF)
- Equivalent to Argentina's AFIP or Brazil's Receita Federal
- Headquartered in Asunción

**Dirección Nacional de Ingresos Tributarios (DNIT)**:
- Operational arm of SET
- Manages:
  - Tax collection
  - Taxpayer registry (RUC - Registro Único de Contribuyentes)
  - Audits and enforcement
  - E-invoicing system (SIFEN)

### 3.2 Human Resources

**Employee Count**: ~1,500-2,000 (estimated)[^16]
- **Comparison**: Argentina's AFIP has ~19,000 employees (2023)
- **Ratio**: Paraguay ~400 taxpayers per SET employee vs. Argentina ~3,000 per AFIP employee

**Caveat**: Exact employee numbers not publicly disclosed by SET; estimates based on budget allocations and regional comparisons.

### 3.3 Digitalization Level

**E-Invoicing System (SIFEN - Sistema Integrado de Facturación Electrónica Nacional)**[^17][^18]:
- **Launch**: 2017 (pilot), 2019 (mandatory for large taxpayers)
- **Current Status**: Mandatory for all new taxpayers since April 2025[^19]
- **Format**: XML-based invoices submitted to SET in real-time
- **Platforms**:
  - E-Kuatia: Web-based invoice generation (free for small businesses)
  - API integration for large companies (Kude, Marangatu providers)

**Other Digital Tools**:
- **RUC Online**: Taxpayer registration (https://marangatu.set.gov.py)
- **Marangatu Portal**: Online tax filing, payment, consultation
- **Mobile App**: "SET Móvil" for tax payment and consultation

**Blockchain/Advanced Tech**: Not implemented as of 2024 (unlike Estonia or Georgia).

### 3.4 Compliance Rates

**Tax Gap** (estimated):
- **VAT Gap**: ~25-30% (OECD estimate)[^20]
- **Income Tax Gap**: ~40-50% (due to large informal economy)
- **Overall Compliance**: Moderate; improving with e-invoicing

**Informal Economy**:
- **Size**: ~35-40% of GDP (World Bank estimate)[^21]
- **Impact**: Reduces effective tax base, necessitating higher rates on formal sector

## 5. HISTORICAL CONTEXT

### 5.1 When Were These Taxes Adopted?

**1991 Tax Reform** (Law No. 125/1991)[^22]:
- Introduced modern **Impuesto a la Renta** (income tax) replacing archaic system
- Established 30% corporate tax rate (later reduced to 10% in 2004)
- Created framework for VAT (replacing cascading sales taxes)

**2004 Reform**:
- **Reduced corporate tax from 30% to 10%**
- Goal: Attract foreign investment, formalize economy
- Result: Revenue initially declined, but formal economy expanded

**2012 Reform** (Law No. 4,851/2012):
- Introduced **Personal Income Tax (IRP)** for first time
  - Previously, only corporate income taxed
  - Progressive rates (8-10%)
  - Threshold: PYG 120 minimum wages

**2019 Modernization** (Law No. 6,380/2019)[^23]:
- Reformed VAT structure
- Introduced dividend tax (8% residents, 15% non-residents)
- Strengthened anti-avoidance rules
- Enhanced SET powers for audits

### 5.2 What System Existed Before?

**Pre-1991**:
- **Cascading sales taxes**: Multiple stages of taxation on same product
- **Export taxes**: On agricultural products (soybeans, cotton)
- **Import duties**: Primary revenue source
- **No modern income tax**: Only outdated "commercial tax" (patente comercial)
- **Total tax pressure**: ~6-8% of GDP (1980s)

**Stroessner Era Influence (1954-1989)**:
- Dictatorship prioritized:
  - Low taxes to attract capital fleeing neighboring crises (Argentina 1970s-80s, Bolivia)
  - Minimal state services (no welfare state)
  - Reliance on hydroelectric revenue (Itaipú Dam royalties)
- **Legacy**: Cultural preference for small government persists

### 5.3 Why Was Simplicity Chosen?

**Economic Rationale**:
1. **Small economy**: ~USD 40B GDP (2024) can't sustain complex bureaucracy
2. **Landlocked country**: Must compete with neighbors (Brazil, Argentina) for investment
3. **Comparative advantage**: Low taxes offset lack of ports, infrastructure

**Political Economy**:
1. **Weak state capacity**: Historically unable to administer complex system
2. **Elite consensus**: Rural elites (soybean exporters) prefer low taxes
3. **No strong labor movement**: No pressure for redistributive taxation (unlike Argentina's Peronism)

**Path Dependence**:
1. **Itaipú Dam**: Royalties from Brazil (~USD 300-400 million/year) reduce need for high taxes
2. **Contraband economy**: Estimated 20-30% of commerce (tri-border area with Brazil, Argentina)
3. **No historical debt crisis**: Never required IMF structural adjustment (unlike Argentina 2001, Brazil 1980s)

## 6. DATA GAPS AND LIMITATIONS

### 6.1 Missing or Estimated Data

1. **Exact SET employee count**: Not publicly disclosed; estimated from budget allocations
2. **Informal economy size**: World Bank estimates range 30-45% of GDP
3. **Tax gap by category**: No official SET publication; inferred from OECD regional averages
4. **Maquila regime revenue loss**: Tax expenditure not quantified in budget

### 6.2 Estimation Methods

- **Revenue figures 2020-2022**: Official MEF data (high confidence)
- **Revenue figures 2023-2024**: Preliminary MEF + IMF projections (medium confidence)
- **Tax/GDP ratio**: OECD methodology (excludes social security from "tax")
- **Comparison to Argentina**: Adjusted for methodological differences (provincial taxes)

## 8. CONCLUSION: KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Simplicity by Design**: Paraguay's 10-10-10 system (10% VAT, 10% IRP, 10% IRE) is intentionally simple, reducing compliance costs and administrative burden.

2. **Territorial Principle**: Only domestic-source income taxed; foreign income exempt. This makes Paraguay attractive for international business but limits revenue potential.

3. **Low Tax Pressure**: 14.5% tax/GDP ratio (2023) is **49% below LAC average** (21.3%) and **57% below OECD average** (33.9%).

4. **Consumption-Reliant**: 47% of tax revenue from VAT and excise taxes. Income taxes (corporate + personal) only 30% of revenue.

5. **Digitalization Progress**: SIFEN e-invoicing system (since 2017) has improved compliance, but tax gap remains ~25-30% for VAT.

6. **No Welfare State**: Low taxes sustainable because Paraguay lacks:
   - Universal pension system
   - Free university education
   - Universal healthcare
   - Large public sector employment

7. **Comparison to Argentina**: Paraguay's tax code is **~10% the size** of Argentina's, with **60% lower tax pressure** (14.5% vs. 30% including provinces).

**Critical Question for Next Research**: Why can Paraguay operate with such low taxes when Argentina requires 2x-3x higher tax pressure? (See Research Output #2)
